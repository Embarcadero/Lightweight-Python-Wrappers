# Lightweight-Python-Wrappers
Lightweight Wrappers based on [Python4Delphi](https://github.com/Embarcadero/Python4Delphi) to make it easy to import Python modules into Delphi components.

This is the foundation of the [Delphi Data Sciences Libraries](https://github.com/Embarcadero/P4D-Data-Sciences) and works with the [Python Enviroments](https://github.com/Embarcadero/PythonEnviroments/).

This is an early access preview, but you are encouraged to try it out, file bug reports, and add features. [Read more](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/?p=145025) and catch the live stream.
